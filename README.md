# GarageControl
Particle Photon + SmartThings = TOTAL GARAGE CONTROL!!!

Voice control with Google Assistant and Alexa are easily integrated with IFTTT.

WebCoRE is used to refresh the door status in SmartThings when
it sees a Particle.publish from the Particle.

TO DO:  - Get SmartThings to see the g#State as open/close sensors so I can use them
          with smartapps like Notify Me When and Smart Lighting

        - Get SmartThings to see the relays as garage doors
